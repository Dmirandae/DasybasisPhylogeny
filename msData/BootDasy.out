RESAMPLE
    Resample matrix, and calculate group supports. 
    Usage: "resample options [ search commands ];"  Options are: 
       allow           during each replication, allow execution of 
                       (almost) all commands, including dangerous ones. 
                       This option should be used sparingly and only when 
                       you really know what you're doing! 
       boot            use normal bootstrapping instead of the default 
                       resampling ("sym"). 
       cut N           cutoff frequency or support 
       errcount N      valid only under sibyl.  This counts the  
                       proportion of groups (out of the total 
                       supported groups) in the reduced data set 
                       that are not supported in the complete data 
                       set (wrong groups) and the proportion of groups 
                       (out of the total) in reference tree N (presu- 
                       mably, consensus of optimal trees for the 
                       complete data set) that are not supported by 
                       the reduced data set (mist groups).

                       must precede all other arguments. See below 
                       for details. 
       slope           summarize results with frequency slopes 
       softboot N      make resampling in bootstrapping milder, by 
                       creating datasets with more characters (as in 
                       Kopuchian & Ramirez 2010). This has an effect 
                       only for "boot" or "poisson"; none for "sym" 
                       or "jak". 
       sym             use symmetric resampling, with p(up)=p(del) 
       zerowt          if doing symmetric resampling, eliminated (give 
                       weight 0) to downweighted characters (=default); 
                       otherwise, divide their weight by 2 (uncontra- 
                       dicted groups appear in all replicates) 
    Taxa can be excluded from consensus calculations, using "/" followed  
    by the list of taxa to exclude.  All options are persistent, except 
    taxon exclusion and "from" 
      
       The backwards jacknife is not a measure of support, but provides 
    instead a sort of stability test. It deletes characters (under 
    independent character removal, with p(del)=0.33); for each case, 
    runs the data (as indicated within square brackets) and count the 
    number of groups supported by the reduced data set that are present 
    in all previously existing trees ("supported") or present in some 
    but not all existing trees ("compatible").  Divide that number by 
    the total number of groups supported in the reduced data set, or by 
    the total number of groups that _could_ be supported in the reduced 
    data set (i.e. nr. of taxa-2 , "normalized"). The existing trees must 
    be provided by the user, and should correspond to a set of optimal 
    trees under current settings. Other than search commands, only the 
    number of replications can be changed, and taxa can be disregarded.

TTAGS
    Handle tree-tag settings. Note that specific tag separators can be 
    defined with the "tread" command. 
    ;       show tree tag(s). 
    |       same, but displaying multiple lines as such in text trees 
    =       store tree tags for subsequent tree printing command(s) 
            (first tree printing command sets the target tree) 
            N.B. If tree and tags stored already, and macros are ON, this  
            can be followed by "<ray" or ">ray". First case sets 
            the tags to the values stored in array "ray"; second case 
            sets values in the array to the values in the tags (tags 
            must be numbers!). Using "<<" or ">>", negative numbers 
            between -1 and -5 are interconverted with symbols "-", "Y", 
            "N", " " (blank), and "X". Using "[" instead of 
            "<", it copies only to internal branches. Instead of printing 
            the values contained the array, it is also possible to print 
            the state names of character C, with "<&C ray" or "[&C ray" 
            (this may greatly facilitate showing specific mappings of a 
            character on a a tree, e.g. in conjunction with "iterrecs"). 
    (       synonym of "=" 
    )       stop storing tags (but don't erase them) 
    -       clear all existing tags 
    +N txt  write "txt" to node N of target tree (copies from first 
            non-blank in "txt" all the way to ending semicolon). 
    >XXX    Change title of tree-tags to XXX 
    <N      erase (i.e. reduce to a minimum) tree-tag for node N 
            Using a second "<" instead of N, erase tree-tags for 
            all terminal branches; with ">", the opposite 
    *N      set tree N as target tree (no labels written). Using 
            "!" instead of "N" the last tree is used 
            If N is followed by "<ray" (or "<<", as in  
            "ttag="), and macros or ON, then  it also sets the  
            tags from the values of the array "ray". Using "[" 
            instead of "<", it copies only to internal branches. 
    /;      save tags in a readable form 
    [       separate tags in new lines, using "\" as separator 
            for each legend (only in graphic trees).  If followed 
            by a number N, then it sets N to be the maximum width 
            of text to be output in multiple lines (0 = no limit, 
            default). If "[" is followed by a, b, c or d, then it 
            sets the position of multiple line tags in graphic  
            trees (i.e. in SVG files), to be 'a'bove, 'b'elow, 
            'c'entered, or 'd'isregarded (height of labels not 
            considered). Default is 'c'. 
    ]       don't separate legends in new lines 
    !       if some multiple lines are empty, wipe'em 
    &xxx    save tree-tags as tree diagram, in SVG (Scalable Vector 
            Graphics, XML) format, to file "xxx".  File name  
            may be followed by: 
               blength N    branch span (width; if using "colors", and 
                            branch lengths indicated with :L, then used 
                            as factor for tree-width). 
               bheight N    branch height 
               thickness N  branch thickness N 
               colors       save as colors.  In this case, the color 
                            is determined by the first digit in the tree- 
                            legend; more than a single digit (or a non-digit) 
                            colors the branch as gray (=ambiguous).  A text 
                            can also be displayed, if the color code is  
                            followed by a forward slash and text. 
               fontsize N   use a font size of N.  Use "tfontsize" or  
                            "bfontsize" to control size of font in terminal 
                            taxa or in tree branches, respectively. 
               italics      ditto, for taxon names (use "bitalics" for branch 
                            legends) 
               pendwidth N  use a font of stroke N (=boldness) 
               txtsep N     if using multi-line legends, separate lines 
                            by N points 
               legup N      raise branch legends by N points 
               shift N      move whole tree N pixels to the right 
               xysave var   save coordinates of every node to variable "var" 
                            (must be a 2-dimensional array), and leave SVG file 
                            open, for subsequent additions of text or SVG  
                            commands (with "ttag&+", see below). File 
                            remains open until closed with "ttag&;". 
               caption xxx  use xxx as caption for tree diagram (copies until  
                            a semicolon found; last option for "ttag &") 
               extra X,Y    leave X,Y points below and to the right of tree 
               rotate       rotate diagram counter-clockwise 
            The resulting SVG file can be opened with any appropriate program 
            (including most web browsers: Firefox, Opera, Safari, Chrome). 
            Color codes (from 0 to 9) are red, blue, green, cyan, brown, pink 
            orange, purple, magenta, and yellow.  Instead of these color codes, 
            it is also possible to indicate RGB codes (in parentheses, separated 
            by commas, optionally followed by branch thickness:length, before 
            closing the parenthesis). You can use dashed lines, if the first 
            color in the RGB code is preceded by a "-". 
    &+      If an SVG file previously left open (with the "xysave" option of 
            "ttag&"), then add text or commands. Options are:  
               write  copy (as in "quote"), verbatim from input to SVG file 
                      Use this to insert SVG commands into file. 
               text   Insert text into SVG file (no need to remember SVG  
                      syntax!). Syntax is:  
                        ttag &+text x y (R,G,B,font size:stroke width) TEXT; 
                      if no RGB code indicated, use font size 12, stroke 1. 
               line   Insert line into SVG file. Syntax:  
                        ttag &+line x1 y1 x2 y2 (R,G,B,width); 
                      If R code negative, then line is dashed. 
               rect   Insert a rectangle into SVG file. Syntax:  
                        ttag &+rect x1 y1 x2 y2 (R,G,B,W) (R,G,B,Op); 
                      First RGB code indicates line color and width W,  
                      second one fill color and opacity Op. If not  
                      indicated, line black and no fill. If first R code  
                      is negative, then line is dashed. Opacity: a 0-100  
                      value (default 100) 
    See also help for "tread", for an option to merge tags from tree-files. 
    NB: thanks to Salvador Arias for showing me the SVG format! 
    NB2: If you wish to display a text in a specific color (with 0-9, IUPAC 
         codes for DNA, or RGB codes), then precede the text by a forward 
         slash and precede the slash by the color code.
