	abstract = {The resolution of phylogenetic relationship among animals is still one of the most challenging problems in systematic zoology. Insect wing is a highly valued morphological character in the systematics, but few studies have been conducted to quantify wing shape variations for phylogenetic reconstruction. In this study, with Cantharinae as the subject, we conducted the GM analyses from hindwings of 16 representative genera. Further, we conducted the UPGMA based on Procrustes distance and Euclidean similarity measure of Mahalanobis distance, respectively, and NJ analysis of the Mahalanobis distance, as well as MP analysis using merged landmark dataset. In the meantime, we constructed the phylogenetic relationships among these genera based on the mitochondrial genomes, with a total of 41 sequences novel to Cantharinae, by BI and ML analyses. As a result, the CVA analysis demonstrated that the hindwing shapes of the cantharid genera are significantly different from one another. All the topologies produced by the GM data partially correspond with that of mitogenomic data. The close relationships of some genera are frequently recovered, including Cyrebion + Themus, Cantharis + Taiwanocantharis + Taocantharis, Stenothemus + Falsopodabrus + Habronychus. These results prove the importance and potential application of the hindwing shapes in recovering the relationships among the sibling genera.},
